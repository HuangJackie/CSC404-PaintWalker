# Paint Walker
When a colorful world is suddenly stripped of its colours,
many of its residents and plantlife await deathâ€™s door.
Follow Nox along in its journey to unravel the origin of the
disappearance of color by painting your way through a puzzle-based
isometric 3D world. Your only hope of salvation is to make clever
use of the limited paint you obtain along the way
to restore life into the world.
