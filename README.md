# Paint Walker
When a colorful world is suddenly stripped of its colours,
many of its residents and plantlife await death’s door.
Follow Nox along in its journey to unravel the origin of the
disappearance of color by painting your way through a puzzle-based
isometric 3D world. Your only hope of salvation is to make clever
use of the limited paint you obtain along the way
to restore life into the world.
